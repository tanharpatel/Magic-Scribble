# Magic Scribble

It's an fun game where users can draw, paint or also jot down quick points. But the interesting part is the way to reach to the scribble board. It is like puzzle. You have to struggle somewhat for accessing the board. This app was published on PlayStore and Amazon AppStore.

### Hints for reaching to Scribble Board:
1) On launching the app you will be taken to blank screen with simple text "Welcome to Magic Scriblle".
2) Now using some kind of gestures you will be headed to another screen with logo.
3) Use your brain :wink:, what to do next... here is some twist
   - you will reach either scribble board or
   - embedded youtube player :hand_over_mouth:
4) If reached scribble board then <b>Hurray! :partying_face: you did it.</b>
5) Else try and try until you reach. :no_mouth:
